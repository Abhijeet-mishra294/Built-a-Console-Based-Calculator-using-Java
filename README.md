A lightweight Java console application that performs basic arithmetic operations. This project demonstrates fundamental Java concepts including user input handling, control flow (switch statements), and basic exception handling.

🚀 Features

- Addition (+): Calculate the sum of two numbers.

- Subtraction (-): Find the difference between two numbers.

- Multiplication (*): Calculate the product of two numbers.

- Division (/): Perform division (includes protection against division by zero).
